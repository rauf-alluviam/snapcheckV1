- ❌ Removed batch approval button and badge
- ❌ Removed API call to fetch batch counts
- ❌ Updated comments to remove batch references

**client/src/pages/Inspections/NewInspectionPage.tsx**
- ❌ Removed `bulkApprovalEnabled` from Workflow interface
- ❌ Removed `pending-bulk` status handling in success messages

**client/src/pages/Workflows/WorkflowDetailPage.tsx**
- ❌ Removed `bulkApprovalEnabled` from initial settings

**client/src/pages/Inspections/BatchApprovalsPage.tsx**
- ❌ **DELETED** - Entire component removed

### 🎯 Application Routing

**client/src/App.tsx**
- ❌ Removed `/batch-approvals` route
- ❌ Removed `BatchApprovalsPage` import

### 📋 Type Definitions

**client/src/types/index.ts**
- ❌ Removed `bulkApprovalEnabled` from Workflow interface
- ❌ Removed `batchId` from Inspection interface
- ❌ Removed `pending-bulk` from inspection status enum

### 📚 Documentation

**README.md**
- ❌ Removed all batch processing API endpoints from documentation
- ❌ Removed bulk approval configuration details
- ❌ Updated automation section to remove batch processing references
- ❌ Simplified workflow features documentation

### 🧪 Test Files

**server/test-route-order.js**
- ❌ **DELETED** - Batch route testing file removed

**client/src/pages/Inspections/InspectionsPage.tsx.new**
- ❌ **DELETED** - Backup file with batch references removed

## Impact on System Functionality

### ✅ What Still Works
- Individual inspection approval workflow
- Multi-approver system (sequential and parallel approval)
- Auto-approval for routine inspections
- All existing inspection management features
- User management and organization features
- Reporting and analytics

### ❌ What's Removed
- Bulk/batch approval of multiple inspections
- Automatic grouping of similar inspections
- Batch notification system
- Bulk approval UI components
- Scheduled batch processing jobs

## Database Migration Notes

⚠️ **Important**: Existing inspections with `batchId` fields or `pending-bulk` status will need to be migrated:

```javascript
// Update existing inspections to remove batch references
db.inspections.updateMany(
  { batchId: { $exists: true } },
  { $unset: { batchId: "" } }
);

// Update pending-bulk status to pending
db.inspections.updateMany(
  { status: "pending-bulk" },
  { $set: { status: "pending" } }
);
```

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Server starts without errors
2. ✅ Client builds without TypeScript errors
3. ✅ No compilation errors in any component
4. ✅ All batch-related routes return 404
5. ✅ UI no longer shows batch approval options

## Benefits of Removal

- **Simplified Codebase**: Reduced complexity by removing ~500+ lines of batch-related code
- **Improved Maintainability**: Fewer components to maintain and test
- **Cleaner Architecture**: Focus on core inspection workflow without batch complexity
- **Better Performance**: No background batch processing jobs
- **Streamlined UX**: Simplified user interface without batch approval confusion

---

✅ **Status**: Batch approval feature has been completely removed from the SnapCheck system while preserving all core inspection management functionality.
