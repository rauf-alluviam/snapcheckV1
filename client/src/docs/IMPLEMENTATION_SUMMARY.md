## Testing

To test the registration flow:

1. Start the client development server:
```
cd d:\snapcheckV1\client
npm run dev
```

2. Start the server:
```
cd d:\snapcheckV1\server
npm start
```

3. Open http://localhost:3000/register in a browser

   - Creating a new organization during registration

## Future Improvements

1. Add loading indicators during organization creation/registration
