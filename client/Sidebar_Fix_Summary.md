# Sidebar Visibility Fix for Desktop Mode

## Problem
The sidebar navigation panel was not visible in desktop mode because it was only showing on large screens (lg: 1024px+), which excluded many desktop users with smaller screens or browser windows.

## Root Cause
- Sidebar was using `hidden lg:flex` classes
- Header mobile menu button was using `lg:hidden` 
- This meant the sidebar only appeared on screens 1024px and above
- For desktop users with screens between 768px-1024px, neither the sidebar nor mobile menu was accessible

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Sidebar Component (`Sidebar.tsx`)
**Before:** `hidden lg:flex lg:flex-col lg:w-64 lg:fixed lg:inset-y-0`
**After:** `hidden md:flex md:flex-col md:w-64 md:fixed md:inset-y-0`

- Changed from `lg:` (1024px+) to `md:` (768px+) breakpoint
- Sidebar now shows on medium screens and above (768px+)

### 2. Updated Header Component (`Header.tsx`)
**Before:** `lg:hidden` for mobile menu button and `lg:ml-6 lg:flex` for title
**After:** `md:hidden` for mobile menu button and `md:ml-6 md:flex` for title

- Mobile menu button now hides on medium screens (768px+) instead of large screens
- Page title shows on medium screens and above

## Responsive Behavior Now

| Screen Size | Sidebar | Mobile Menu Button | Behavior |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|----------|
| < 768px (Mobile) | Hidden | Visible | Mobile menu overlay |
| 768px+ (Tablet/Desktop) | Visible | Hidden | Fixed sidebar navigation |

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test on different screen sizes:**
   - Mobile (< 768px): Should show mobile menu button
   - Tablet/Desktop (768px+): Should show fixed sidebar

2. **Test browser window resizing:**
   - Start with narrow window and expand
   - Verify sidebar appears/disappears at 768px breakpoint

3. **Test navigation functionality:**
   - Click navigation items in sidebar
   - Verify active states work correctly
   - Check user profile area in sidebar

## Additional Notes

- The layout uses flexbox with `w-0 flex-1` for the content area, which automatically adjusts for the fixed sidebar
- No changes needed to the main layout logic - just responsive breakpoints
- The 768px breakpoint (md:) is more appropriate for desktop sidebar visibility than 1024px (lg:)

## If Issues Persist

If the sidebar is still not visible, check:
1. Browser console for any CSS/JavaScript errors
2. Tailwind CSS is properly loaded
3. Screen width is actually above 768px
4. No other CSS is overriding the sidebar styles
